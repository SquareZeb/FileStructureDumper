# FileStructureDumper
A super basic python script that dumps all of the file directories for each Snowdrop Engine asset exported in pure raw format into a nice list in a txt file.

You can do anything with the code as you'd like. I have both the source code as well as the compiled exe for all types of users.

You can grab the exe from the releases tab, on the very right.

If Windows detects this as a virus, just run the .py or compile it yourself. Windows Defender doesn't like scripts that go through directories and write them down.
